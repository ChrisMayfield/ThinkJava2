"""

A class for reading the contents of a file, modifying it in
memory, and writing it back.

A Filist is a list of strings that contains the contents of
a file.  All the usual list operations can be applied to a Filist.

Because this class loads the entire file into memory, it uses
more space than it might need to, and it is limited to working with
files that fit into memory.  The advantage is that it is easy to
implement algorithms that need random access to the contents of the
file, and it is convenient to debug because all the data is
available all the time.

Some of the methods I included are here because of specific
operations I was interested in.
