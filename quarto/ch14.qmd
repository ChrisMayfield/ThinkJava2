# Extending Classes {#eights}

In this chapter, we present a more comprehensive example of
object-oriented programming.

*Crazy Eights* is a classic card game for two or more players. The main
objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Here's
how to play:

-   Deal five or more cards to each player, and then deal one card face
    up to create the "discard pile". Place the remaining cards face down
    to create the "draw pile".

-   Each player takes turns placing a single card on the discard pile.
    The card must match the rank or suit of the previously played card,
    or be an eight, which is a "wild card".

-   When players don't have a matching card or an eight, they must draw
    new cards until they get one.

-   If the draw pile ever runs out, the discard pile is shuffled (except
    the top card) and becomes the new draw pile.

-   As soon as a player has no cards, the game ends, and all other
    players score penalty points for their remaining cards. Eights are
    worth 20, face cards are worth 10, and all others are worth their
    rank.

You can read <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights> for more
details, but we have enough to get started.

## CardCollection

To implement Crazy Eights, we need to represent a deck of cards, a
discard pile, a draw pile, and a hand for each player. And we need to be
able to deal, draw, and discard cards.

The `Deck`{.java} and `Pile`{.java} classes from the previous chapter
meet some of these requirements. But unless we make some changes,
neither of them represents a hand of cards very well.

Furthermore, `Deck`{.java} and `Pile`{.java} are essentially two
versions of the same code: one based on arrays, and the other based on
`ArrayList`{.java}. It would be helpful to combine their features into
one class that meets the needs of both.

We will define a class named `CardCollection`{.java} and add the code we
want one step at a time. Since this class will represent different piles
and hands of cards, we'll add a `label`{.java} attribute to tell them
apart:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public class CardCollection {

    private String label;
    private ArrayList<Card> cards;

    public CardCollection(String label) {
        this.label = label;
        this.cards = new ArrayList<Card>();
    }
}
```

As with the `Pile`{.java} class, we need a way to add cards to the
collection. Here is the `addCard`{.java} method from the previous
chapter:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void addCard(Card card) {
    this.cards.add(card);
}
```

Until now, we have used `this`{.java} explicitly to make it easy to
identify attributes. Inside `addCard`{.java} and other instance methods,
you can access instance variables without using the keyword
`this`{.java}. So from here on, we will drop it:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void addCard(Card card) {
    cards.add(card);
}
```

We also need to be able to remove cards from the collection. The
following method takes an index, removes the card at that location, and
shifts the following cards left to fill the gap:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card popCard(int i) {
    return cards.remove(i);
}
```

If we are dealing cards from a shuffled deck, we don't care which card
gets removed. It is most efficient to choose the last one, so we don't
have to shift any cards left. Here is an overloaded version of
`popCard`{.java} that removes and returns the last card:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card popCard() {
    int i = cards.size() - 1;    // from the end of the list
    return popCard(i);
}
```

`CardCollection`{.java} also provides `isEmpty`{.java}, which returns
`true`{.java} if there are no cards left, and `size`{.java}, which
returns the number of cards:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public boolean isEmpty() {
    return cards.isEmpty();
}
```

``` {.java language="Java"}
public int size() {
    return cards.size();
}
```

To access the elements of an `ArrayList`{.java}, you can't use the array
`[]`{.java} operator. Instead, you have to use the methods `get`{.java}
and `set`{.java}. Here is a wrapper for `get`{.java}:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card getCard(int i) {
    return cards.get(i);
}
```

`lastCard`{.java} gets the last card (but doesn't remove it):

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card lastCard() {
    int i = cards.size() - 1;
    return cards.get(i);
}
```

In order to control the ways card collections are modified, we don't
provide a wrapper for `set`{.java}. The only modifiers we provide are
the two versions of `popCard`{.java} and the following version of
`swapCards`{.java}:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void swapCards(int i, int j) {
    Card temp = cards.get(i);
    cards.set(i, cards.get(j));
    cards.set(j, temp);
}
```

Finally, we use `swapCards`{.java} to implement `shuffle`{.java}, which
we described in Section [13.2](#shuffle){reference-type="ref"
reference="shuffle"}:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void shuffle() {
    Random random = new Random();
    for (int i = cards.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        int j = random.nextInt(i + 1);
        swapCards(i, j);
    }
}
```

## Inheritance

At this point, we have a class that represents a collection of cards. It
provides functionality common to decks of cards, piles of cards, hands
of cards, and potentially other collections.

However, each kind of collection will be slightly different. Rather than
add every possible feature to `CardCollection`{.java}, we can use
**inheritance** to define subclasses. A **subclass** is a class that
"extends" an existing class; that is, it has the attributes and methods
of the existing class, plus more.

Here is the complete definition of our new and improved `Deck`{.java}
class:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public class Deck extends CardCollection {

    public Deck(String label) {
        super(label);
        for (int suit = 0; suit <= 3; suit++) {
            for (int rank = 1; rank <= 13; rank++) {
                addCard(new Card(rank, suit));
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The first line uses the keyword `extends`{.java} to indicate that
`Deck`{.java} extends the class `CardCollection`{.java}. That means a
`Deck`{.java} object has the same instance variables and methods as a
`CardCollection`{.java}. Another way to say the same thing is that
`Deck`{.java} "inherits from" `CardCollection`{.java}. We could also say
that `CardCollection`{.java} is a **superclass**, and `Deck`{.java} is
one of its subclasses.

In Java, classes may extend only one superclass. Classes that do not
specify a superclass with `extends`{.java} automatically inherit from
`java.lang.Object`{.java}. So in this example, `Deck`{.java} extends
`CardCollection`{.java}, which in turn extends `Object`{.java}. The
`Object`{.java} class provides the default `equals`{.java} and
`toString`{.java} methods, among other things.

Constructors are *not* inherited, but all other `public`{.java}
attributes and methods are. The only additional method in `Deck`{.java},
at least for now, is a constructor. So you can create a `Deck`{.java}
object like this:

``` {.java language="Java"}
Deck deck = new Deck("Deck");
```

The first line of the constructor uses `super`{.java}, which is a
keyword that refers to the superclass of the current class. When
`super`{.java} is used as a method, as in this example, it invokes the
constructor of the superclass.

So in this case, `super`{.java} invokes the `CardCollection`{.java}
constructor, which initializes the attributes `label`{.java} and
`cards`{.java}. When it returns, the `Deck`{.java} constructor resumes
and populates the (empty) `ArrayList`{.java} with `Card`{.java} objects.

That's it for the `Deck`{.java} class. Next we need a way to represent a
hand, which is the collection of cards held by a player, and a pile,
which is a collection of cards on the table. We could define two
classes, one for hands and one for piles, but there is not much
difference between them. So we'll use one class, called `Hand`{.java},
for both hands and piles. Here's what the definition looks like:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public class Hand extends CardCollection {

    public Hand(String label) {
        super(label);
    }

    public void display() {
        System.out.println(getLabel() + ": ");
        for (int i = 0; i < size(); i++) {
            System.out.println(getCard(i));
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

Like `Deck`{.java}, the `Hand`{.java} class extends
`CardCollection`{.java}. So it inherits methods like `getLabel`{.java},
`size`{.java}, and `getCard`{.java}, which are used in `display`{.java}.
`Hand`{.java} also provides a constructor, which invokes the constructor
of `CardCollection`{.java}.

In summary, a `Deck`{.java} is just like a `CardCollection`{.java}, but
it provides a different constructor. And a `Hand`{.java} is just like a
`CardCollection`{.java}, but it provides an additional method,
`display`{.java}.

## Dealing Cards {#dealing}

To begin the game, we need to deal cards to each of the players. And
during the game, we need to move cards between hands and piles. If we
add the following method to `CardCollection`{.java}, it can meet both of
these requirements:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void deal(CardCollection that, int n) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        Card card = popCard();
        that.addCard(card);
    }
}
```

The `deal`{.java} method removes cards from the collection it is invoked
on, `this`{.java}, and adds them to the collection it gets as a
parameter, `that`{.java}. The second parameter, `n`{.java}, is the
number of cards to deal. We will use this method to implement
`dealAll`{.java}, which deals (or moves) all of the remaining cards:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void dealAll(CardCollection that) {
    int n = cards.size();
    deal(that, n);
}
```

At this point, we can create a `Deck`{.java} and start dealing cards.
Here's a simple example that deals five cards to a hand, and deals the
rest into a draw pile:

``` {.java language="Java"}
Deck deck = new Deck("Deck");
deck.shuffle();

Hand hand = new Hand("Hand");
deck.deal(hand, 5);
hand.display();

Hand drawPile = new Hand("Draw Pile");
deck.dealAll(drawPile);
System.out.printf("Draw Pile has %d cards.\n",
                  drawPile.size());
```

Because the deck is shuffled randomly, you should get a different hand
each time you run this example. The output will look something like
this:

    Hand:
    5 of Diamonds
    Ace of Hearts
    6 of Clubs
    6 of Diamonds
    2 of Clubs

    Draw Pile has 47 cards.

If you are a careful reader, you might notice something strange about
this example. Take another look at the definition of `deal`{.java}.
Notice that the first parameter is supposed to be a
`CardCollection`{.java}. But we invoked it like this:

``` {.java language="Java"}
Hand hand = new Hand("Hand");
deck.deal(hand, 5);
```

The argument is a `Hand`{.java}, not a `CardCollection`{.java}. So why
is this example legal?

It's because `Hand`{.java} is a subclass of `CardCollection`{.java}, so
a `Hand`{.java} object is also considered to be a
`CardCollection`{.java} object. If a method expects a
`CardCollection`{.java}, you can give it a `Hand`{.java}, a
`Deck`{.java}, or a `CardCollection`{.java}.

But it doesn't work the other way around: not every
`CardCollection`{.java} is a `Hand`{.java}, so if a method expects a
`Hand`{.java}, you have to give it a `Hand`{.java}, not a
`CardCollection`{.java} or a `Deck`{.java}.

If it seems strange that an object can belong to more than one type,
remember that this happens in real life too. Every cat is also a mammal,
and every mammal is also an animal. But not every animal is a mammal,
and not every mammal is a cat.

## The Player Class

The `Deck`{.java} and `Hand`{.java} classes we have defined so far could
be used for any card game; we have not yet implemented any of the rules
specific to Crazy Eights. And that's probably a good thing, since it
makes it easy to reuse these classes if we want to make another game in
the future.

But now it's time to implement the rules. We'll use two classes:
`Player`{.java}, which encapsulates player strategy, and
`Eights`{.java}, which creates and maintains the state of the game. Here
is the beginning of the `Player`{.java} definition:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public class Player {

    private String name;
    private Hand hand;

    public Player(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.hand = new Hand(name);
    }
```

A `Player`{.java} has two `private`{.java} attributes: a name and a
hand. The constructor takes the player's name as a string and saves it
in an instance variable. In this example, we have to use `this`{.java}
to distinguish between the instance variable and the parameter with the
same name.

The primary method that `Player`{.java} provides is `play`{.java}, which
decides which card to discard during each turn:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card play(Eights eights, Card prev) {
    Card card = searchForMatch(prev);
    if (card == null) {
        card = drawForMatch(eights, prev);
    }
    return card;
}
```

The first parameter is a reference to the `Eights`{.java} object that
encapsulates the state of the game (coming up in the next section). The
second parameter, `prev`{.java}, is the card on top of the discard pile.

`play`{.java} invokes two helper methods: `searchForMatch`{.java} and
`drawForMatch`{.java}. Since we have not written them yet, this is an
example of top-down design.

Here's `searchForMatch`{.java}, which looks in the player's hand for a
card that matches the previously played card:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card searchForMatch(Card prev) {
    for (int i = 0; i < hand.size(); i++) {
        Card card = hand.getCard(i);
        if (cardMatches(card, prev)) {
            return hand.popCard(i);
        }
    }
    return null;
}
```

The strategy is pretty simple: the `for`{.java} loop searches for the
first card that's legal to play and returns it. If there are no cards
that match, it returns `null`{.java}. In that case, we have to draw
cards until we get a match, which is what `drawForMatch`{.java} does:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card drawForMatch(Eights eights, Card prev) {
    while (true) {
        Card card = eights.drawCard();
        System.out.println(name + " draws " + card);
        if (cardMatches(card, prev)) {
            return card;
        }
        hand.addCard(card);
    }
}
```

The `while`{.java} loop runs until it finds a match (we'll assume for
now that it always finds one). The loop uses the `Eights`{.java} object
to draw a card. If it matches, `drawForMatch`{.java} returns the card.
Otherwise it adds the card to the player's hand and repeats.

Both `searchForMatch`{.java} and `drawForMatch`{.java} use
`cardMatches`{.java}, which is a static method, also defined in
`Player`{.java}. This method is a straightforward translation of the
rules of the game:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public static boolean cardMatches(Card card1, Card card2) {
    return card1.getSuit() == card2.getSuit()
        || card1.getRank() == card2.getRank()
        || card1.getRank() == 8;
}
```

Finally, `Player`{.java} provides a `score`{.java} method, which
computes penalty points for cards left in a player's hand at the end of
the game.

## The Eights Class

In Section [13.2](#shuffle){reference-type="ref" reference="shuffle"},
we introduced top-down design. In this way of developing programs, we
identify high-level goals, like shuffling a deck, and break them into
smaller problems, like choosing a random element or swapping two
elements.

In this section, we present **bottom-up design**, which goes the other
way around: first we identify simple pieces we need and then we assemble
them into more-complex algorithms.

Looking at the rules of Crazy Eights, we can identify some of the
methods we'll need:

-   Create the deck, the players, and the discard and draw piles. Deal
    the cards and set up the game. (`Eights`{.java} constructor)

-   Check whether the game is over. (`isDone`{.java})

-   If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and move the
    cards into the draw pile. (`reshuffle`{.java})

-   Draw a card, reshuffling the discard pile if necessary.
    (`drawCard`{.java})

-   Keep track of whose turn it is, and switch from one player to the
    next. (`nextPlayer`{.java})

-   Display the state of the game, and wait for the user before running
    the next turn. (`displayState`{.java})

Now we can start implementing the pieces. Here is the beginning of the
class definition for `Eights`{.java}, which encapsulates the state of
the game:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public class Eights {

    private Player one;
    private Player two;
    private Hand drawPile;
    private Hand discardPile;
    private Scanner in;
```

In this version, there are always two players. One of the exercises at
the end of the chapter asks you to modify this code to handle more
players. The `Eights`{.java} class also includes a draw pile, a discard
pile, and a `Scanner`{.java}, which we will use to prompt the user after
each turn.

The constructor for `Eights`{.java} initializes the instance variables
and deals the cards, similar to
Section [14.3](#dealing){reference-type="ref" reference="dealing"}. The
next piece we'll need is a method that checks whether the game is over.
If either hand is empty, we're done:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public boolean isDone() {
    return one.getHand().isEmpty() || two.getHand().isEmpty();
}
```

When the draw pile is empty, we have to shuffle the discard pile. Here
is a method for that:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void reshuffle() {
    Card prev = discardPile.popCard();
    discardPile.dealAll(drawPile);
    discardPile.addCard(prev);
    drawPile.shuffle();
}
```

The first line saves the top card from `discardPile`{.java}. The next
line transfers the rest of the cards to `drawPile`{.java}. Then we put
the saved card back into `discardPile`{.java} and shuffle
`drawPile`{.java}. We can use `reshuffle`{.java} as part of the
`draw`{.java} method:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Card drawCard() {
    if (drawPile.isEmpty()) {
        reshuffle();
    }
    return drawPile.popCard();
}
```

The `nextPlayer`{.java} method takes the current player as a parameter
and returns the player who should go next:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public Player nextPlayer(Player current) {
    if (current == one) {
        return two;
    } else {
        return one;
    }
}
```

The last method from our bottom-up design is `displayState`{.java}. It
displays the hand of each player, the contents of the discard pile, and
the number of cards in the draw pile. Finally, it waits for the user to
press the [Enter]{.sans-serif} key:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void displayState() {
    one.display();
    two.display();
    discardPile.display();
    System.out.println("Draw pile:");
    System.out.println(drawPile.size() + " cards");
    in.nextLine();
}
```

Using these pieces, we can write `takeTurn`{.java}, which executes one
player's turn. It reads the top card off the discard pile and passes it
to `player.play`{.java}, which you saw in the previous section. The
result is the card the player chose, which is added to the discard pile:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void takeTurn(Player player) {
    Card prev = discardPile.lastCard();
    Card next = player.play(this, prev);
    discardPile.addCard(next);

    System.out.println(player.getName() + " plays " + next);
    System.out.println();
}
```

Finally, we use `takeTurn`{.java} and the other methods to write
`playGame`{.java}:

``` {.java language="Java"}
public void playGame() {
    Player player = one;

    // keep playing until there's a winner
    while (!isDone()) {
        displayState();
        takeTurn(player);
        player = nextPlayer(player);
    }

    // display the final score
    one.displayScore();
    two.displayScore();
}
```

Done! The result of bottom-up design is similar to top-down: we have a
high-level method that calls helper methods. The difference is the
development process we used to arrive at this solution.

## Class Relationships

This chapter demonstrates two common relationships between classes:

composition:

:   Instances of one class contain references to instances of another
    class. For example, an instance of `Eights`{.java} contains
    references to two `Player`{.java} objects, two `Hand`{.java}
    objects, and a `Scanner`{.java}.

inheritance:

:   One class extends another class. For example, `Hand`{.java} extends
    `CardCollection`{.java}, so every instance of `Hand`{.java} is also
    a `CardCollection`{.java}.

Composition is also known as a **HAS-A** relationship, as in
"`Eights`{.java} has a `Scanner`{.java}". Inheritance is also known as
an **IS-A** relationship, as in "`Hand`{.java} is a
`CardCollection`{.java}". This vocabulary provides a concise way to talk
about an object-oriented design.

There is also a standard way to represent these relationships
graphically in UML class diagrams. As you saw in
Section [10.7](#UML){reference-type="ref" reference="UML"}, the UML
representation of a class is a box with three sections: the class name,
the attributes, and the methods. The latter two sections are optional
when showing relationships.

<figure id="fig.uml1">
<div class="center">
<p><img src="figs/uml1.png" style="width:75.0%"
alt="UML class diagram showing inheritance relationships between Card, Hand, Deck, and Player classes, with composition arrows showing HAS-A relationships between classes" /></p>
</div>
<figcaption>UML diagram for the classes in this chapter.</figcaption>
</figure>

Relationships between classes are represented by arrows: composition
arrows have a standard arrow head, and inheritance arrows have a hollow
triangle head (usually pointing up).
Figure [14.1](#fig.uml1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig.uml1"}
shows the classes defined in this chapter and the relationships among
them.

UML is an international standard, so almost any software engineer in the
world could look at this diagram and understand our design. And class
diagrams are only one of many graphical representations defined in the
UML standard.

## Vocabulary

inheritance:

:   The ability to define a new class that has the same instance
    variables and methods of an existing class.

subclass:

:   A class that inherits from, or extends, an existing class.

superclass:

:   An existing class that is extended by another class.

bottom-up design:

:   A way of developing programs by identifying simple pieces,
    implementing them first, and then assembling them into more-complex
    algorithms.

HAS-A:

:   A relationship between two classes in which one class "has" an
    instance of another class as one of its attributes.

IS-A:

:   A relationship between two classes in which one class extends
    another class; the subclass "is" an instance of the superclass.

## Exercises

The code for this chapter is in the *ch14* directory of
*ThinkJavaCode2*. See page  for instructions on how to download the
repository. Before you start the exercises, we recommend that you
compile and run the examples.

::: exercise
**Exercise 14.1**. *Design a better strategy for the
`Player.play`{.java} method. For example, if there are multiple cards
you can play, and one of them is an 8, you might want to play the 8.*

*Think of other ways you can minimize penalty points, such as playing
the highest-ranking cards first. Write a new class that extends
`Player`{.java} and overrides `play`{.java} to implement your strategy.*
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 14.2**. *Write a loop that plays the game 100 times and keeps
track of how many times each player wins. If you implemented multiple
strategies in the previous exercise, you can play them against each
other to evaluate which one works best.*

**Hint:* Design a `Genius`{.java} class that extends `Player`{.java} and
overrides the `play`{.java} method, and then replace one of the players
with a `Genius`{.java} object.*
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 14.3**. *One limitation of the program we wrote in this
chapter is that it handles only two players. Modify the `Eights`{.java}
class to create an `ArrayList`{.java} of players, and modify
`nextPlayer`{.java} to select the next player.*
:::

::: exercise
**Exercise 14.4**. *When we designed the program for this chapter, we
tried to minimize the number of classes. As a result, we ended up with a
few awkward methods. For example, `cardMatches`{.java} is a static
method in `Player`{.java}, but it would be more natural if it were an
instance method in `Card`{.java}.*

*The problem is that `Card`{.java} is supposed to be useful for any card
game, not just Crazy Eights. You can solve this problem by adding a new
class, `EightsCard`{.java}, that extends `Card`{.java} and provides a
method, `match`{.java}, that checks whether two cards match according to
the rules of Crazy Eights.*

*At the same time, you could create a new class, `EightsHand`{.java},
that extends `Hand`{.java} and provides a method, `scoreHand`{.java},
that adds up the scores of the cards in the hand. And while you're at
it, you could add a method named `scoreCard`{.java} to
`EightsCard`{.java}.*

*Whether or not you actually make these changes, draw a UML class
diagram that shows this alternative object hierarchy.*
